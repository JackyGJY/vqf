# Variation Quantum Factoring

## Introduction

This repository contains implementation of the algorithm presented in the article "Variational Quantum Factoring", by Eric R. Anschuetz, Jonathan P. Olson, Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik, Yudong Cao. It's available on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08927).

## Differences from the paper

Below you can find a list of things I implemented differently from the paper:

- To perform simulations I decided to use pyQuil instead of QuTiP.
